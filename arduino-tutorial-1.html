    <h1>Arduino Tutorial 1: Introduction to Arduino</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the FlexTech Library's introductory Arduino tutorial. The intention of this tutorial is to familiarize students with the basics of an Arduino Uno Microcontroller.</p>

    <h3>Required Materials:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Arduino Uno Microcontroller</li>
        <li>USB A/B Cable</li>
        <li>A Functioning Computer with a USB A port.</li>
        <li><a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software" target="blank">Arduino Software</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hardware</h3>

    <p>Let's take a minute to get ourselves familiar with the hardware. The Arduino Uno Microcontroller is a small function machine that is designed to retain and execute a code, and read and write to and from different inputs and outputs. The physical board has many pins on it, where you can plug in either inputs or outputs for power or electrical signals. It also has a USB B port, for use with a computer, and a power port, which is used when you need to power the arduino without a computer. The Arduino also has a 'reset' button, which is located right next to the large USB B port. This button is used to stop and restart the code. In this tutorial, we will be focusing on the USB B port, the pin labeled '13', and the yellow LED associated with pin 13.</p>
    <p>The cable we will be using to connect our Arduino to the computer is a USB A/B cable. This cable has a USB A connector (the flat and rectangular plug) and a USB B connector (the taller and more square plug). The USB B connector goes into the Arduino, while the USB A connector goes into the computer.</p>

    <h3>Software*</h3>

    <p>To make a program in Arduino, we have to have the Arduino Software, which can be downloaded <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software" target="blank">here</a> for free. Once downloaded, move the Arduino application into your 'Applications' folder. Launch the Arduino program by double-clicking it. Once the program is open, you can save your sketch by pressing the 'command' and 's' keys. The sketch should have then saved to a folder named 'Arduino' in your 'Documents' folder.</p>
    <p><font size="1">*Note, this software guide is primarily for Mac OSX. A Windows OS version will come soon.</font>
    </p>

    <h2>Writing the Code</h2>

    <p>Now we are ready to begin writing our code. To begin, you must open the Arduino Software. Once done, you can review and rewrite the below code into the Arduino Software.</p>
    <p><font size="1">Note that the '//' text denotes a comment. A comment is a string of text that is not read or executed by the program. This is useful for telling a reader what a line of code does, or keeping old code that you don't want to delete yet.</font>
    </p>
