    <p>Run on sentences, the thing we all hate, have a habbit of being organized poorly, resulting in annoyance, and a negative impression on the writer of the setence, as well as being uttely pointless, like an umbrella, in that umbrellas don't work very well, and they don't communicate well at all, which further proves its stupidity and expresses its creativity at the same time; it is excessively, as well as boringly, distasteful to write one, with the exception of this one, which surpasses all other run on sentences in a most magnificent, eligent, and extravegant manner.
