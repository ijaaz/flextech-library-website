    <p>Welcome to the Arduino Tutorials page. Listed below are our current tutorials for the Arduino Uno Microcontroller. If you are new to Arduino, we suggest using Tutorial 1.</p>

    <p>Run on sentences, the thing we all hate, have a habit of being organized poorly, resulting in annoyance, and a negative impression on the writer of the sentence, as well as being utterly pointless, like an umbrella, in that umbrellas don't work very well, and they don't communicate well at all, which further proves its stupidity and expresses its creativity at the same time; it is excessively, as well as boringly, distasteful to write one, with the exception of this one, which surpasses all other run on sentences in a most magnificent, elegant, and extravagant manner.
